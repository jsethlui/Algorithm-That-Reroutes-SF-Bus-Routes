# Algorithm-That-Reroutes-SF-Bus-Routes
By using Google's OR-Tools, the same Python optimization modules used in Google Map search algorithms, this program determines the most efficient bus route given a bus line. Output prints the most efficient route by bus stop, and the total distance

Feel free to run the program in any Python IDE, either Pytron or Sublime Text
